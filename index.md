# CROSSHub

This document describes how to upload data to the CROSS data platform.


## Prepare the data

The first step for submitting data is preparing the data files.  The platform accepts two types of [data files](/instructions-data/docs/files): CSV and Excel. 
We use a standard naming of [variable names](/instructions-data/docs/variables). 

{: .important }
The submission will throw and error if the standard variable names are not used 


## Upload the data

Once you prepared the data, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Go to the [upload page](https://app.sweetcross.link/dashboard) 
2. Sign in with your model credentials
3. Upload the Excel or CSV file


## Problems by uploading data

If you encounter problems when uploading data, please send an email to [sweet-cross](mailto:sweet.cross.ch[at]gmail.com?subject=technicalproblem) with the file you were uploading and the description of the error
